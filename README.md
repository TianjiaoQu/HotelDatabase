# ROC Hotel Database Management System

The hotel database management system is designed to function for hotels where customers enjoy control over their hotel experience including mobile based booking, check-in, check-out, and room service requests, where hotel managers have access to read and update real-time information regarding their properties and customers.

The web interface has a single home which is a login page for both the administrator and customers. Based on the username and password, they will be directed to different pages where they can view information by links on navigation bar.

There are two kinds of users to the hotel management system: A hotel manager as database administrator is a user with full access to the database system, who have complete control over the system such as updating customer information, retrieve customers booking and billing information, etc. Customers are users with partial access to the database system, who have access to room and booking data. They are able to register, view and make reservations, view and place orders, view their billing information and make payment as well as view up-to-date hotel and room information.
